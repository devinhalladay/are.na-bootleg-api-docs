# bootleg api docs for are.na
the real treasure is the endpoints we gathered along the way

---
# context
are.na's api is extremely useful and lots of people love to build things with it. but the more we build, the more we discover two things:
1. we could really use some new api endpoints to help build tools and things more easily; and
2. the api documentation is kinda out of date, so there are actually many endpoints to discover!

let's all collect tidbits we learn about the are.na api along the way, with the hope of contributing back to the official documentation in a meaningful way :)
